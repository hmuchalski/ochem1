## Introduction

Welcome to CHEM 128A! It's great to have you in the course. I'm Dr. Hubert Muchalski, the professor for this course. 

In Organic Chemistry 1 you will learn about structure, properties, and reactivity of organic compounds. Carbon-based molecules are central to a host of chemical and biological processes because of their broad range of structure and reactivity. The billions of organic compounds alone, ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals, make the field important for study. Yet, organic chemistry is also a highly integrated discipline that impacts and is impacted by the other branches of chemistry and other sciences, because **organic chemistry enables a molecular understanding of physicochemical phenomena in materials science, the environment, biology, and medicine**. Because the field has reached a high level of integration with these areas, progress in organic chemistry continues at a fast pace and much more remains to be discovered.

### About this syllabus

This document contains all the information you need to navigate the course. *Read it once giving it your full attention*, then search as needed. Use the table of contents found in the left sidebar of the web version. Click "Expand All" to see the subsections in the table. You can also hit `Ctrl/Cmd+F` to bring up a search field, and then type in the text you are looking for. When you see blue- or purple-underlined text in the syllabus or any other document, it's a clickable link. For example, [click here for pictures of dogs in clothes](https://start.duckduckgo.com/?q=dogs+wearing+clothes&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images&kp=1). Once the syllabus is finalized, it will be available in electronic form (here) and as a PDF. 

Before reading any further, here are some things to know:

1. **The pace of this course is fast**. We will cover approximately one chapter per week and there is a lot of material introduced in each chapter. New chapters build on the content introduced in prior chapters. To reduce the risk of falling behind, start working on assignments immediately,check announcements, ask questions and resists the urge to procrastinate.
2. **College-level chemistry is more than just memorizing structures and reactions**. You will be asked to do more than just give answers to problems. Your goal should be to seek deep understanding of underlying concepts because they are universal and the list is much shorter than a disconnected list of reactions and reagents.
3. **Make sure you understand the grading system.** It is definitely different from what you experienced in the past.
4. **Expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this course.** Nothing of true value comes easily and requires a great deal of time and attention. There will be a good deal with ambiguity of the concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave your comfort zones on a regular basis and challenge your current understanding of chemistry.
5. **Your success in the course depends on your willingness to be actively engaged during class time**. We will spend most of the in-class time practicing the skills related to learning targets. Students who approach the class with a passive mindset typically struggle, and often fail. Those who approach it with growth mindset, on the other hand, often surprise themselves with how much and how well they learn. You will need to stay engaged by participating in class meetings and on the class discussions. Students who succeed in this course have few things in common: they ask questions, seek understanding (not answers), form study groups, and help others learn.
6. **Asking questions is a not a sign of weakness**. It is guaranteed that you will be confused, lost, and stuck every day we meet in class. **That's a good sign!** Asking and answering questions requires you to leave your comfort zones on a regular basis, but is a crucial ingredient in learning. 

> [!NOTE]
> Success in the course doesn't come cheap. Learning hard things involves hard work, a willingness to try things that might not work the first time, and the ability to improve using feedback. But I promise you that I will work to make CHEM 128A a class where you can make mistakes and grow safely and productively.
