# About this document

In the syllabus and on the Canvas pages I regularly refer to *successful* or *acceptable* student work without. This document aims to define what constitutes _successful_ work on each type of assignment in the course. 

# Standards for Class Primers

Class Primers are assignments done prior to the class meeting. You get credit for completing the assignment before the deadline and giving each item a good faith effort to solve it correctly. 

|    Mark    |                                                                   Criteria                                                                    |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  **Success**  | Every item that is not marked "Optional" has a complete and good-faith response and work is submitted prior to the time of grading. |
| **Incomplete** |   Either there is a question whose response is left blank (and is not marked "Optional"), OR the work is submitted late. |

- **Correct answers are not required on Class Prep**, only a complete good faith effort to answer all the required items. In fact, one of the reasons we do Class Prep is to surface any misconceptions or errors in thinking that you might be having at the beginning of a new topic, so we can work on those in class. Honest mistakes are welcome.
- Omission of an item not marked "Optional" from the responses results in an Incomplete. This applies even if the omission was accidental, so be sure to double-check your responses to look for items unintentionally left blank. 
- Items that have a response consisting only of "I don't know", "I don't understand", etc. will be treated as blank responses. That is, such responses will result in an *Incomplete* on the entire assignment. You do not have to be correct in your responses, but you must *try* to be correct and respond to the assignment items with your best understanding, even if you have questions. 

## Adaptive WileyPLUS Assignments

Class Primer assignments on WileyPLUS are adaptive quizzes, mostly containing multiple choice questions. The system will serve questions from 3-5 sections of the textbook that I select. As you answer questions you will see the `Progress Bar` move, forward or backward depending on how well you know the answers. Once you pass the threshold of 50% you earn credit for this assignment (shows as in Canvas as `1`). 

>[!NOTE]
>All WileyPLUS assignments use adaptive learning engine. This means that then number and difficulty of questions is determined by how you are doing. Before each batch of questions you will be asked to review relevant sections in the textbook. Incorrect answers are not penalized. Instead, the difficulty is adjusted until you answer correctly, although some additional review may be needed. I encourage you to continue to answer questions to reach 100% on the `Progress Bar`. 

# Standards for Learning Targets

Each Learning Target quiz has its own set of **Success Criteria** that will be listed on the quiz. Your work will be marked *Success* if the work meets the success criteria. Otherwise it will be marked *Retry* and you'll receive feedback on your work. LT problem appear on multiple Checkpoints, so you have multiple chances to Succeed on each.

# Standards for Class Journal papers

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The main criteria for Class Journal articles is the quality of the solution and the clarity of commentary and explanation given by the author.

Class Journal articles are the most complex and integrated assignments you will do in CHEM 128-series course. Getting a right answer is not the object of a Class Journal article. Some problems may have multiple right answers or not have a single right answer and ask you to identify the challenges that are standing in the way. 

Journal submisstions are evaluated on the basis of *completeness, correctness, and communication quality*. Solutions are marked as follows:

|      Mark      | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  **Success**   | The work on the problem is complete, correct, clearly communicated, and professionally presented. Shows in Canvas as `1`. |
|   **Retry**    | The work on the problem shows a good-faith effort to be complete, correct, clearly communicated, and professionally presented, but there is at least one significant issue that shows a lack of full understanding of the concepts and needs revision. Shows in Canvas as `0`. |
| **Incomplete** | The work on the problem is not a good-faith effort at being complete, correct, clearly communicated, and professionally presented. Shows in Canvas as `blank`. |

The four attributes of a successful Class Journal article are: 

- completeness,
- correctness,
- clear communication, and 
- professional presentation. 

## Completeness

The target audience for Class Journal articles is a student like you---person who havs some background chemistry knowledge that, but who has no familiarity with the problem described in the article. *The instructor (prof. Muchalski) is not the audience*---don't assume that the person reading the solution has a graduate degree in organic chemistry or has been studying the topic before. Completeness means that all required parts of the solution are present and explained, with no major gaps left for the reader to fill in. 

If you can't honestly say that a student in CHEM 128A could follow the solution from beginning to end and agree with your conclusions without doing any additional work on the side, then your writeup needs further editing. (And it will probably be marked *Revise* if submitted.)

## Correctness

The work should be free of major errors. The types of errors I see most often in Class Journals are factual and semantic errors. Factual errors results from misstating definitions, misidentifying structural elements (labeling a ketone as an aldehyde), or . Semantic error happens when you make a statement that is grammatically correct, but the statement itself has no meaning in the context of organic chemistry. The statement "[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously](https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously)" is an example. So is the statement "Compound 3 is a diastereomer" Semantic errors often happen when applying a concept to the wrong kind of object (like using the word "diastereomer" to describe a molecule). 

## Clear communication

Clear communication** means presenting the flow of your ideas in a way that makes it easy to understand. Clearly communicated solutions to organic chemistry problems are typically a blend of both English and chemistry languages that maximizes the clarity of what you are trying to say. The solution should thoughtfully combine chemistry and verbal explanations to be clear and convincing to the intended audience. A solution that is a "wall of structures, reactions, mechanisms, diagrams" without commentary is not considered clear. And neither is  a block of text describing the solution without using visual aid of organic chemistry language and symbolism (structures, reactions, mechanisms, diagrams). 

When English is used, the language should be simple (not peppered with jargon), to the point, and free of grammatical and spelling errors. Where chemistry visual language is used, the structures are valid well organized. 

## Professional presentation

The article looks good. This is the reason why Class Journals must by typed up on a computer. Chemical structures can be drawn by hand or with ChemDraw and embedded into the document. It is possible, but quite difficult for beginners, to draw reaction mechanisms using ChemDraw. When reaction mechanism is a part of the solution, it can be drawn by hand on paper and then digitized. 

## Automatic "incomplete"

Finally, please note that when you submit work for Class Journal, you're expected to give a good-faith effort at a complete and correct solution. If there are issues, you can always revise and resubmit. But a submission will be marked *Incomplete* and returned to you without further comment if any of the following are found:

- Significant portions of the solution that are not submitted, or which are not good-faith efforts at a correct or complete solution. This includes partial work with questions about how to get started or how to finish; please do not submit these, but rather come to drop-in hours with questions. 
- Pervasive errors in communication, including incorrect English usage;
- Handwritten work (except for curved-arrow mechanisms); 
- Work that is poorly formatted or confusingly organized; or

The list above is not all-inclusive. But, before turning in work, use it as a checklist --- if your work has any of those attributes, don't turn it in yet!
