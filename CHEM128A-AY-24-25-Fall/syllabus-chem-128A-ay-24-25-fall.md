## Introduction

Welcome to CHEM 128A! It's great to have you in the course. I'm Dr. Hubert Muchalski, the professor for this course.

In Organic Chemistry 1 you will learn about structure, properties, and reactivity of organic compounds. Carbon-based molecules are central to a host of chemical and biological processes because of their broad range of structure and reactivity. The billions of organic compounds alone, from amino acids, benzene, and cyclohexane derivatives, to xanthanes, ylides, and zwitterions, make the field important for study. At the same time, organic chemistry is also a highly integrated discipline that impacts and is impacted by the other branches of chemistry and other sciences, because **organic chemistry enables understanding of cellular machinery of living organisms, physical properties of materials, effects of chemicals on the environment, and how medicines work**. Because the field has reached a high level of integration with these areas, progress in organic chemistry continues at a fast pace and much more remains to be discovered.

### How to have a good experience in CHEM 128A

> "Learning is not fun. Knowledge is fun but learning is discouraging, uncomfortable, and hard."

> -- Unknown source

Organic chemistry has poor reputation among college students because it is hard and demands lots of work. Success in the course depends on your willingness to try things that might not work the first time, and the ability to improve using feedback. I am committed to provide learning environment where students can construct their knowledge of organic chemistry and grow safely and productively.

In this course you can expect:

- A learning environment that is challenging but also supportive of the learning process.
- Transparent grading practices that prioritize growth.
- Course content that compounds over time and concepts that are recurring throughout the semester.
- Solicitations for your feedback that are taken seriously.
- Respect for you as a human who is here to learn.

I firmly believe that success in CHEM 128A is possible for every student but it is not effortless. On your end, your success in the course depends on three things:

1. **Active engagement during class time.** The best way to learn anything is to be an active participant in the process. Students who approach the class with a passive mindset typically struggle, and often fail. Those who approach it with an active mindset, on the other hand, often surprise themselves with how much and how well they learn. Make it a priority not to just attend and take notes, but learn by doing.
2. **Asking questions.** The material in CHEM 128A is challenging, and you will almost certainly be confused on a regular basis. When you recognize that you are confused or stuck, remember that **it is a expected during a meaningful learning process.** Waiting for things to make sense on their own is a poor strategy. If a thought occurs to you that *"It's only me who doesn't get it and others have if all figured out"*, don't believe it. *Ask questions* of me and your classmates and take action to make sense of the material.
3. **Good management of time, tasks, and information.** Understanding the material won't help you if you procrastinate, skip announcements, or don't use a calendar. All course information will be clearly laid out for you, but it's up to you to import that information into your own lives and act on it. If you can commit to these, then I have every expectation that you'll succeed in the course, no matter what your prior chemistry background.

### Why study organic chemistry?

"To be an organic chemist, or course!" one might say. The fact is, that less than 1% of all students I taught this course in the past are practicing chemists or pursue a graduate degree in the physical sciences. For most students this course is just a part of the curriculum or a requirement for an advanced training program in health-related field. Then why is this course a hard requirement for many career paths? Successful completion of organic chemistry is [a signal to the outside world][signaling]. It demonstrates your competence in self-regulated learning, proving that you can quickly learn hard abstract concepts and that you know how to work with models and theories. Doing well in organic chemistry also reveals that you can manage time and tasks, and that you can use highly technical language to communicate with peers.

## Course goals and structure

The goal of this course is to illustrate that by understanding the principles of bonding and reactivity chemists can design molecules that serve specific function, especially in the contexts relevant to other disciplines: medicine, biology, and material science. To get closer to achieving course goal, we will focus on a variety of skills.

### Course learning objectives

At the successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Use common drawing and naming conventions to represent the structure and properties of organic molecules.
- Explain macroscopic physical properties of compounds using molecule-level phenomena (polarity and intermolecular forces).
- Use curved arrow notation to draw mechanisms of chemical transformations.
- Analyze chemical structures and reactions to make predictions about chemical processes.
- Predict products of chemical reactions.
- Propose a synthesis of an organic molecule.
- Explain the reasoning behind solutions to problems clearly to an appropriate audience.
- Connect the ideas of organic chemistry with your own personal and professional interests.

The skills and conceptual knowledge that you'll learn in the course are encapsulated in a list of 14 Learning Targets, six (6) of which are labelled as CORE targets and represent the essential skills that every CHEM 128A student should possess by the end of the course. You can find that list in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-list-of-learning-targets), and it's linked elsewhere on our various course sites.

### Course content and workflow

To achieve course-level objectives we need material to work with. Topics in this course will be roughly follow the order of chapters in the textbook. Each class meeting has activities for you to do before, during and after the class. For details on specific assignment types, see the next section.

**Before class.** To prepare for class your task will be to complete **Class Primer** assignments and get familiar with the basic concepts related to the topic of the upcoming class and review previously covered material. I will provide a list of suggested reading and video content for you to review before the lesson. You'll then complete a small set of basic questions and exercises. This way, you'll come to class ready to work, and we can skip lectures on the basics in class unless it's really needed.

**During class.** Wee will be focused on *answering questions* and *doing active work*, both intended to make it easy for you to make sense of the material and ask questions so you can maximize the impact of your studying between classes.

**After class.** You will continue to engage with the material through practice and deliberation on the ideas discussed in class. You will return to relevant sections of the textbook to review diagrams and illustrations. The goal of these activities is to prepare you to attempt **Learning Target** problems on Checkpoints and work on **Integrated Problems**.

A typical week could be structured as follows:

1. **Monday** - Class meeting: Q&A from Class Primer and active work on more advanced concepts
2. **Tuesday** - Complete Class Primer for Wednesday
3. **Wednesday** - Class meeting: Q&A from Class Primer and active work on more advanced concepts
4. **Thursday** - Review of the concepts, solving additional problems, work on Integrated Problems
5. **Friday** - Review of the concepts, solving additional problems, work on Integrated Problems
6. **Saturday** - Complete Class Primer for Monday
7. **Sunday** - If you stay current on work during the week you should have Sundays free to do the busy work other professors assign in their courses.

## Assessments and grading

### Types of assessments

The course uses a grading system that emphasizes *growth* and your work will be required to meet certain levels of quality that demonstrate mastery of the material. You will be engaging with several kinds of activities in the course, both to facilitate learning of the material and to demonstrate how well you have learned it. There are three areas that contribute to your course grade:

- Mastery of basic skills (the craft);
- Application of those basic skills (integration); and
- Engagement, effort, and participation (community).

#### Mastery of basic skills

[Course-level learning objectives](#course-learning-objectives) are too broad to be assessed and are further broken down into 14 *Learning Targets*, (see the complete list in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-list-of-learning-targets)). Each learning target is focused on a specific skill and/or content we will be studying. Six (6) of these are designated as **CORE** skills and mastering those is one of the requirements for passing the course.

You demonstrate your learning by solving **LT Problems** during Checkpoints, in-class times set aside for assessment. Think of Checkpoints as exams. For each *Learning Target* I set three levels of achievement: *Beginner*, *Proficient*, and *Master*. Detailed rubrics on how those marks are given can be found in the [Standards for Student Work][standards-for-student-work] document.

#### Application of skills

Using cooking as analogy, a chef uses their knowledge of ingredients and basic skills to prepare a dish or a meal. Similarly, *Integrated Problems* will assess broader range of skills and knowledge that span multiple Learning Targets. Solving integrated problems will require use of multiple basic OChem skills *and* communication skills to compose and convey the answer.
*Integrated Problems* will be released roughly every other week. The problems may have multiple parts composed of basic and extended practice problems, and harder problems that involve applications. Think of this assignment as a short paper that is evaluated as a whole using a rubric found in the [Standards for Student Work][standards-for-student-work] document.

#### Engagement

Ongoing engagement with the course is an important part of the learning process. **Class Primers** and **iClicker polls** are two ways you can earn **Engagement Credits**.

**Class Primers** are pre-class assignments designed to give you the basic knowledge of terms, ideas, and basic concepts that will allow us to jump right into applications when we get to class. They involve reading the textbook, asking questions about what you read, and completing *Skill Exercises*. Think of this as *Homework*.

**iClicker Credits** are earned by participation in polls during class. Polls give me real-time feedback and help steer class discussions. They are also my way of encouraging you to attend class meetings. You will receive one credit if you participate in, i.e., give answer to, 75% of questions asked in class session. You should try your best to answer correctly but correctness is not factored into the score, only participation. The number of questions in polls will vary; sometimes only two or three questions.

### How course final grades are determined

Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn a particular letter grade, all requirements in the column for that grade must be met. Failing grade (F) is given if all the requirements for a "D" are not met.  If the total number of assignments of a given type is changed due to scheduling or other issues, this table will be updated.

| Category (total)          | D   | C  | B  | A  |  
| ------------------------- | --- | -- | -- | -- |  
| Class Primers             | 8   | 12 | 16 | 20 |  
| iClicker Credits          | 8   | 12 | 16 | 20 |  
| Learning Targets Mastered | 5   | 7  | 10 | 13 |  
| Integrated Problems       | N/A | 1  | 4  | 8  |  

#### Bottom line

If you master half of the *Learning Targets*, show some evidence of being able to apply the basic skills, and stay reasonably engaged in the class, you can expect to pass the class with a grade of "C". Students who aspire to earn an "A" must master nearly all LTs (including all CORE), consistently show they can apply basic skills to solve *Integrated Problems*, and stay consistently engaged and prepared for class.

> [!CAUTION]
CORE Learning Targets are the most important. Failing to earning *Master* on all `CORE` LTs will result in one letter grade reduction (for example from B to C). The numbers for the *Learning Targets* column refer to the number of LTs for which you earn *Master* rating (shown in Canvas as `2`). Marks of *Proficient* (`1`) or *Beginner* **do not count**.

#### Borderline cases

With nearly 40 students in the class, each on a different path to the final grade, it sometimes happens that a student completes almost all requirements (all except for one). I will use my professional judgment and look at the student's engagement and effort and leave an option of assigning a grade that is higher (but never lower) than the syllabus indicates. Therefore, it is to your benefit to show that you are engaged and invested in achieving learning objectives of the course.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Higher score in one category cannot be used as argument to "prop-up" insufficient score in another category. For example, earning *Master* on more LT Problems will not compensate for lower score on Integrated Problems. Also, you don't have to do it all. If you aim for "A", you **do not** have to complete *every* Learning Target.

### Why I think this is a better approach to grading

The grading system outlined above may be unusual, but in my view has several advantages:

- Many assignments can be revised or reattempted if you need to improve your work ([see the next section below](#revisions-and-reattempts)), and once you have demonstrated *Mastery* on a *Learning Target*, *Integrated Problem*, you do not have to revisit it again in the course. It's possible that if you do well on the Checkpoints, you will only need to work a fraction of the final exam. Many times, students just opt out of the final altogether if they have strong performances throughout the semester.
- If you're off to a shaky start and your marks early in the semester are poor, you have time to practice and improve and past results don't hurt your final grade.
- The final letter grade is like a score in a video game---it stay the same or goes up.
- Points, statistics, and unethical approaches such as grading on a curve are not involved. Your grade is tracked with a checklist.

The main downside of this grading system is that it can be complicated and convoluted. The section about grading is by far the longest part of this syllabus. In my experience, however, most students "get it" after a few weeks, and I am always happy to clarify the situation.

As a teacher and learner, I strongly believe that *learning takes time* and that grading your work based on a single point of data, such as a single quiz or test, is inaccurate, invalid, and perhaps unethical. A truly valid measure of learning has to involve *multiple attempts* that allow you to learn from (and correct) your past mistakes and demonstrate not only your skill, but also your growth. I believe you should not be penalized for having a bad day that results in a bad test score, so long as you can show evidence that you've *eventually* learned what you need to learn. Course learning objectives are phrased as "at the end of the course the student should be able to…". Thus, nothing is final until the end of the course.

### Note on Canvas Gradebook

Canvas developers insist that assignments have point value which goes against my grading philosophy. You will notice that Canvas assignments have point values and will say something like "This assignment does not count toward the final grade". **Ignore this statement.** It means that it is not included in the total point count you see in the gradebook because we don't use points-based grading. *Numbers are used as marks that indicate progress*.

| Assignment          | Shows on Canvas  | Can be reattempted? |  
| :------------------ | :--------------- | :------------------ |  
| Class Primer        | `1` or `0`       | No                  |  
| iClicker Credits    | total            | No                  |  
| Learning Target     | `0`, `1`, or `2` | Yes                 |  
| Integrated Problems | `0` or `1`       | Yes                 |  

### Revisions and reattempts

#### Learning Targets

Each Checkpoint contains new LT problems as well as new versions of older ones. If you attempt an LT problem and do not earn *Master* on it, you can reattempt it at the next Checkpoint. For each Learning target you will have 3-4 opportunities to earn *Master* rating. Detailed rubrics on how those marks are given can be found in the [Standards for Student Work][standards-for-student-work] document.

| Checkpoint      | Date  | Learning Targets | Time allotted |  
| :-------------- | :---- | :--------------- | :----------- |  
| Checkpoint 1    | 9/4   | 1-3              | 30 min       |  
| Checkpoint 2    | 9/18  | 1-5              | 45 min       |  
| Checkpoint 3    | 10/9  | 1-8              | 60 min       |  
| Checkpoint 4    | 10/23 | 6-10             | 30 min       |  
| Checkpoint 5    | 11/13 | 1-13             | 75 min       |  
| Checkpoint 6    | 12/11 | 4-14             | 75 min       |  
| Final Exam      | 12/18 | 1-14             | 75 min       |  

#### Integrated Problems

You can revise and resubmit each Integrated Problem once (total of two attempts). Your initial attempt will get verbal or written feedback on it, and you can use the feedback to make corrections and/or improvements that are called for. Solutions are submitted on Canvas in an assignment area; revisions are simply submitted to the same assignment area as a new version.

Integrated Problems will come with a deadline for initial submissions. You must submit a complete, good-faith effort on the assignment prior to the deadline in order to be eligible to revise or resubmit it. Examples of situations where revision would not be allowed include the following:

- The assignment is not submitted at all before the deadline (In other words you cannot "revise" an assignment you did not turn in).
- The assignment is submitted but some parts of the problem are skipped or omitted either partially or entirely, or includes responses saying something like "I didn't know how to do this part" but no significant attempt at a solution.
- The assignment is submitted but the work has significant issues or errors throughout. This usually occurs when it is difficult to tell if there is any understanding of the concepts.

Revisions of Integrated Problems sets also have a deadline. No revisions are accepted past that deadline. No revisions or reattempts on any item are allowed after 11:59 pm PT on Sunday, December 8. This is the beginning of the last week of classes, and no revisions or reattempts are allowed after that point so that the queue of items to grade can be cleared prior to the finals week.

## Getting help

As mentioned, you will almost certainly find yourself lost, stuck, or confused on *something* in this course at some point. This is not a defect in your character or intelligence; it's a sign you are being challenged, and you can turn that challenge into real growth by **seeking out help as soon as you need it**. Make every effort to get yourself unstuck and resolve your questions on your own first. But then:

- **Attend office hours and ask questions there.**  No appointment needed.
- [Schedule an appointment through Google Calendar][1-on-1-calendar] if drop-in hours don't work for you.
- **Work with a classmate** as long as you're staying within bounds on academic honesty above. In particular, working in groups on Class Primer is a very good idea and will help keep you from getting stuck at the beginning of a new concept.

## Instructor availability and message responses

**You can ask a question about anything at any time.** You have both the right and the responsibility to ask questions about anything in the course you don't fully understand, whether math or some aspect of the syllabus or anything else. You can use email, office hours, appointments, or grab me before or after class.

However, please note that I cannot always respond immediately to messages. In particular **I do not typically check email between 6:00pm and 8:00am on weeknights**, and **I do not typically check email at all on weekends** in order to prioritize time for family and other non-work pursuits. That said,

- Messages sent on a weekday (Monday-Friday) before 3:00 pm will likely get a response *the same day*.
- Messages sent after 3:00 pm Monday-Thursday will get a response *the next day*.
- Messages sent after 3:00 pm on Fridays or on the weekend will get a response *the following Monday*.

**Please plan ahead for instructor availability.** For example if you have something to turn in on a Friday, and you send a question by email after 3:00pm, my reply may not come in time to help you; plan ahead for contingencies like this.

## Course policies

### Academic integrity

This course  is subject to [Standards of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.fresnostate.edu/studentconduct/academic-integrity/) and  [The Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.fresnostate.edu/academics/facultyaffairs/documents/apm/236.pdf). Every student has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.

None of these policies should be necessary because there's no need to be academically dishonest thanks to the revision/resubmission policy. Rather than engage in academic dishonesty and putting your entire career at risk, just turn in your best complete good-faith effort on assignments. And then, if revisions are needed, you'll typically get the chance. The important thing in CHEM 128A is not the grade, it's the understanding and growth you get from engaging in a feedback loop on your work.  

> [!IMPORTANT] TL;DR
> When you submit work on an assignment in this class, it must be your ideas and your voice, and not someone else's or those of an AI. Anything else is subject to strong penalties that are required by the university.

Any action or behavior that misrepresents one’s contributions to or the results of any scholarly product submitted for credit, evaluation, or dissemination will be considered academic misconduct. For example:

- *Cheating*: Attempting to use materials, information, or aids that have not been authorized by the instructor for academic work.
- *Collusion*: Unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing academic assignments offered for credit, and collaboration with another person to commit a violation of any section of the rules on academic misconduct. Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are included in the definition of "another person".
- *Dual submission*: Submitting work that has been previously graded, or is being submitted concurrently to more than one course, without authorization from the instructor of the class to which the student wishes to submit. (This especially applies to those who are repeating CHEM 128A.)
- *Plagiarism*: Appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or obtaining by any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source without any indication or citation of the original source, including words, sentences, ideas, illustrations, structure, computer code, and other expression or media, and presenting that material as one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in conjunction with a program, course, or degree requirements.

Please note that this is not a complete list; and note that **enabling others** to engage in academic misconduct is a form of academic misconduct.

In CHEM 128A, when you submit an item for grading, it must represent *your* ideas and be written in *your* voice, however flawed those may be. Your work cannot significantly consist of ideas or wording from another person or from an AI tool. Specific guidelines for each form of assignment are:

- **Learning Target problems**: These are completed on paper during a class meeting. No collaboration is allowed, and no notes are allowed.
- **Integrated Problems**: Sometimes these are extensions of simpler problems that we do in groups during class, and you can use the results of that collaboration. Otherwise, you are allowed to consult with another person or an AI tool, if the issue pertains to **terminology** used in the problem, or very high-level discussions about **what the problem is asking for**. But no collaboration with people or AI is allowed on any question or strategy that involves actually solving the problem. In other words, you cannot ask AI tool to tell you "Howe to solve the problem".
- **Class Primer and iClicker**: You're allowed, actually encouraged, to collaborate freely with others on these as long as you are obeying the general rule that the work you turn in is your ideas and your voice. If there is ever an exception, you'll be told in advance.

I have no interest in creating a police state in my courses. But I am obliged to investigate any evidence I perceive in which a student is submitting work that does not faithfully represent their own understanding. This investigation may involve discussions about the work or a request to reproduce the work or something like it, in a face-to-face meeting.

You can ask me (Dr. M.) any question you want, about anything, at any time. Getting help from the professor is not academic dishonesty! In case I cannot answer a question because it would reveal spoilers for the solution, I'll tell you so and it will be no big deal. Asking a question will never be held against you.

### Attendance and participation

Attendance is expected at all class meetings. The pace of the course is such that missing a class will result in falling behind almost immediately, and it's very hard to recover. iClicker credits are the incentive to attend classes regularly. Participation is an essential element of attendance. As mentioned before, the class is designed using flipped learning model where the majority of in-class time is spent on active participation, as opposed to passive observation of the instructor lecturing from slides.

### Absences

Student absences (planned, unplanned, and for University-sponsored activities) will be handled according to the [*Policy on Student Absences (APM 232)*][apm232].

If you must be absent, you do not need prior permission or justification, but a notification will be appreciated. However, *please avoid any non-essential absences* such as skipping class, or scheduling a vacation during a day where class is scheduled. If you miss, you are solely responsible for catching up. Missing a class meeting may also mean missing a Checkpoint. In most cases, you will have an opportunity to attempt the problem at the next Checkpoint.

### Deadlines and late work

Deadlines for Class Primers, and Integrated Problems are listed on Canvas. In cases of apparent conflict between dates (different date on a description page and different in the calendar), always assume that the Course Calendar is right.

### Technology issues when submitting work

It is the student’s responsibility to make sure these items are submitted on time, even if technology issues arise. Technology issues that are avoidable or resolved with a simple work-around will not be considered valid grounds for a deadline extension. For example, if you are trying to upload work to Canvas and Canvas won’t accept the file, you should try again later, use different browser, upload to Google Drive and share a private link or send the file as an email attachment until you can upload it successfully.

### Intellectual Property

Students are prohibited from any unauthorized recording, dissemination, or publication of any academic presentation, including any online classroom instruction, for any commercial purpose. In addition, students may not record or use virtual/online instruction in any manner that would violate copyright law. Students are to use all online/virtual instruction exclusively for the educational purpose of the online class in which the instruction is being provided. Students may not re-record any online recordings or post any online recordings on any other format (e.g., electronic, video, social media, audio recording, web page, internet, hard paper copy, etc.) for any purpose without the explicit written permission of the faculty member providing the instruction. Exceptions for disability-related accommodations will be addressed by Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) working in conjunction with the student and faculty member.

### Dropping the course

Dates and details on withdrawing from courses are described on the [Admissions web pages](http://fresnostate.edu/studentaffairs/are/registration/add-drop-deadlines.html).

A *serious and compelling reason* is defined as an unexpected condition that is not present prior to enrollment in the course that unexpectedly arises and interferes with a student's ability to attend class meetings and/or complete course requirements. The reason must be acceptable to and verified by the instructor of record and the department chair. The condition must be stated in writing on the appropriate form. The student must provide documentation that substantiates the condition. Failing or performing poorly in a class is not an acceptable "serious and compelling reason" within the University policy, nor is dissatisfaction with the subject matter, class or instructor.

### University policies and disclaimers

In addition to course policies, you are expected to be familiar with Academic Regulations described in the [University Catalog](http://www.fresnostate.edu/catalog/academic-regulations/) as well as policies listed below.

## Appendix A: List of Learning Targets

1. (`CORE`) I can deduce bonding information (hybridization, formal charge, geometry, valence, charge polarization) embedded in chemical representations. I can draw Lewis structures compliant with the bond-line (zig-zag, skeletal) convention.
2. I can identify functional groups, condensed formulas, and common alkyl groups. I can convert between different drawing conventions as well as recognize implicit carbons and hydrogens in a structure.
3. (`CORE`) I can distinguish between localized and delocalized bonding systems. I can draw resonance forms to show electron delocalization and assess their relative contribution to the overall electronic character of the molecule.
4. (`CORE`) I can rationalize acidity and basicity trends of organic molecules according to the Brønsted–Lowry theory.
5. I can predict the position of acid-base equilibrium and choose a suitable reagent for an efficient proton transfer reaction.
6. I can use various projections of structures and conformational analysis to assess the relative energy of conformations of chain molecules and cyclohexane derivatives.
7. (`CORE`) I can use IUPAC nomenclature rules to convert structure to name and name to structure, including markers of absolute (R/S) and relative (*cis*/*trans*, *E*/*Z*, *syn*/*anti*) stereochemical information.
8. I can identify types of isomeric relationships between molecules. I can use drawings of structures and projections to demonstrate the stereoisomeric relationship between molecules.
9. (`CORE`) I can identify reaction mechanism patterns and draw curved arrows to illustrate bond-forming and bond-breaking steps. I can draw structures of transition states and reactive intermediates. I can identify nucleophilic and electrophilic centers in organic molecules.
10. I can categorize chemical transformations as substitution, addition, or elimination. I can determine the change in enthalpy using values of bond dissociation energy. I can use reaction-energy diagrams to communicate the kinetics and thermodynamics of chemical reactions.
11. (`CORE`) Given an incomplete chemical reaction scheme, I can provide missing reactants, products, or reagents & conditions for transformations involving alkenes.
12. I can identify the monomer and type of polymerization (cationic, anionic, or radical) needed to prepare a given polymer. I can draw a mechanism of formation of a polymer chain.
13. Given an incomplete chemical reaction scheme, I can provide missing reactants, products, or reagents & conditions for transformations involving alkynes
14. Given an incomplete chemical reaction scheme, I can provide missing reactants, products, or reagents & conditions for transformations involving alkyl halides and sulfonates.
<!-- 15. I can explain the selectivity and divergent reaction pathways of nucleophilic substitution and elimination reactions using conformational analysis and curved arrow mechanisms.  -->
