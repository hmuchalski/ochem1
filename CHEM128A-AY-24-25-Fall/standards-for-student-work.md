## About this document

In the syllabus and on the Canvas pages I regularly refer to standards that determine *successful* or *acceptable* student work. This document aims to define these standards and specifications each type of assignment in the course.

This document is of equal importance as the Syllabus and Calendar in terms of guiding your progress in the course. Study it carefully and refer to it each time before submitting an assignment, to ensure you're giving your best effort and to minimize the number of revisions and resubmissions you will do.

## General Standards for all student work

- The complete solution is composed of a correct answer to the problem as well as clear, correct, and complete explanation/commentary. It is not enough just to give a correct answer to a problem.
- You should write as if the reader is a student like you. The reader is one of your classmates, who has the same level of training and background as you, but who has no familiarity with the problem you are solving. They should be able to follow your solution from beginning to end and agree with your answer, without having to do much or any extra work. If your explanation skips steps; or simply asserts that something is true rather than explains why; or uses language that is unclear or hard to follow; or is disorganized or illogical; or other such things, you'll probably be asked to revise and resubmit.
- Solutions to problems should generally be free of any significant errors, and you should try to submit work that is totally free of these. Make sure to read the section below that defines what is considered an "significant error".
- Minor errors are typically ignored as long as there are not too many of them. An error is "minor" if it is not central to the concept being assessed. Rather than hashing out partial credit, we'll just ignore mistakes that are small and don't pertain to the main concept. But please note, an error that is minor in one problem might be significant in another!

## So, what is an "error"?

There are four main kinds of major errors that can affect a solution to a problem:

1. *Invalid Lewis structure*. This is when you draw a chemical structure that violates rules of bonding. For example, structure with an atom that exceeds octet of electrons (carbon with 5 bonds). This is, by far, the most common error and depending on the situation, it can be a significant (major) error or a minor error. Always strive to find and fix them before submitting work.
2. *Factual error*. This results from misstating definitions, names, steps of a mechanism, or parameters in a reaction. This category includes errors in use of arrows, including curved arrows in mechanisms.
3. *Logical error*. This is when you draw incorrect conclusions from data. Students are very good at noticing correlations in the data build their explanations based on a flawed reasoning.
4. *Semantic error*. This happens when you make a statement that is grammatically correct, but the statement itself has no meaning. For example the statement "*CHEM 128A is a very purple unicorn*" obeys the rules of the English language, but it makes no sense.[^1] The same is true of the statement, "*Compound X is a diastereomer*". At best, this statement is incomplete. The word "diastereomer" is like word "brother", it's not a label, it defines relationship. Semantic errors can be hard to catch before making them. They will be politely pointed out in your feedback to help you spot and correct them.

I will refer to these kinds of errors by name in your feedback. Everyone will make at least one of these at some point, and you'll be able to revise when you make them; just be aware that these errors exist and what we mean by the names.

## Standards for Class Primers

Class Primers are assignments done prior to the class meeting. You get credit for completing the assignment before the deadline and giving each item a good faith effort to solve it correctly.

- **Success** mark is given when the work is submitted by the deadline and every item that is not marked "Optional" has a complete and good-faith response.
- **Incomplete** mark is given when the work is not turned on time; or there at least one non-optional item left unanswered (even if accidental) or has a response indicating insufficient effort.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Correct answers are not required on Class Primers, only a complete good faith effort to answer all the required items and timeliness. One of the reasons we do Class Primers is to surface any misconceptions or errors in thinking that you might be having at the beginning of a new topic, so we can work on those in class. Honest mistakes are welcome.
> - Giving a response like "I don't know", "I don't understand", etc. will be treated as blank responses and will be marked as incomplete.

## Standards for Learning Targets

Each Learning Target problem has its own set of criteria for success listed on the problem page. Your work will be marked *Master*, *Proficient*, or *Beginner* depending on to what extend the work meets the stated criteria.

- **Master** mark is given when each part of the problem has a response that is free from significant errors, has correct answers, and each answer is supported by a clear explanation either in English or in chemistry conventions that are clearly shown. Shows in Canvas as `2`.
- **Proficient** mark is given when partial evidence of understanding of the concepts is shown from the work. Either there is one or more significant error, or an answer that appears with insufficient explanation. Shows in Canvas as `1`
- **Beginner** mark is given when the problem has been attempted, but the solution contains multiple significant errors or is presented without sufficient explanation. Shows in Canvas as `0`

> [!NOTE]
> It is not enough just to get right answers. You must also provide a clear explanation for your answers. Your goal on a LT Problem is to provide sufficient evidence that you have mastered the concept in the problem. It is not to your advantage to withhold any such evidence or expect that I will infer what you had in mind when you produced the solution. So provide clear chemical steps and a brief but clear English explanation in order to give sufficient evidence to warrant a **Master** grade.

## Standards for Integrated Problems

Integrated Problems must contain a solution to the problem but also commentary and guidance for the reader. The expectation is that the short paper with the solution will be a standalone artifact of organic chemistry knowledge from which a reader can learn. Integrated Problems submissions may require additional technology.

Journal submissions are evaluated on the basis of *completeness, correctness, and communication quality*. Solutions are marked as follows:

- **Success** mark is given if the work on the problem is complete, correct, clearly communicated, and professionally presented (more on thie [below](#completeness)). Shows in Canvas as `1`.
- **Retry** mark is given if the work on the problem shows a good-faith effort to solve the problem. However, there are repeated significant errors (or a critical error) that show a lack of full understanding of the concepts and in my judgment you'd benefit from revising the problem; or the explanation is insufficient or needs revision. Shows in Canvas as `0`.

> [!NOTE]
> As stated in the Syllabus, every part of the Integrated Problem must have a good-faith effort at a complete, clear, and correct solution. Leaving a problem blank, or skipping one or more parts of a problem, or giving a solution with little to no explanation, or giving a partial solution (it's correct up to a point and then says something like "I didn't know where to go from here") will not be graded **and it will not** eligible for a revision.

## Attributes of a good solution to Integrated Problem

### Completeness

The target audience for Integrated Problem solutions is a student like you---person who has some background chemistry knowledge that, but who has no familiarity with the problem described in the article. *The instructor (prof. Muchalski) is not the audience*---don't assume that the person reading the solution has a graduate degree in organic chemistry or has been studying the topic before. Completeness means that all required parts of the solution are present and explained, with no major gaps left for the reader to fill in.

If you can't honestly say that a student in CHEM 128A could follow the solution from beginning to end and agree with your conclusions without doing any additional work on the side, then your writeup needs further editing. (And it will probably be marked *Revise* if submitted.)

### Correctness

The work should be free of major errors. The types of errors I see most often in Integrated Problems are factual and semantic errors. Factual errors results from misstating definitions, misidentifying structural elements (labeling a ketone as an aldehyde). Semantic error happens when you make a statement that is grammatically correct, but the statement itself has no meaning in the context of organic chemistry. Semantic errors often happen when applying a concept to the wrong kind of object (like using the word "diastereomer" to describe a molecule, not relationship).

### Clear communication

Clear communication means presenting the flow of your ideas in a way that makes it easy to understand. Clearly communicated solutions to organic chemistry problems are typically a blend of both English and chemistry languages that maximizes the clarity of what you are trying to say. The solution should thoughtfully combine chemistry and verbal explanations to be clear and convincing to the intended audience. A solution that is a "wall of structures, reactions, mechanisms, diagrams" without commentary is not considered clear. And neither is a block of text describing the solution without using visual aid of organic chemistry language and symbolism (structures, reactions, mechanisms, diagrams).

When English is used, the language should be simple (not peppered with jargon), to the point, and free of grammatical and spelling errors. Where chemistry visual language is used, the structures are valid well organized.

### Professional presentation

The paper should look good. This is the reason why Integrated Problems lookought to be typed up on a computer. Chemical structures can be drawn by hand or with ChemDraw and embedded into the document. It is possible, but quite difficult for beginners, to draw reaction mechanisms using ChemDraw. When reaction mechanism is a part of the solution, it can be drawn by hand on paper and then digitized.
